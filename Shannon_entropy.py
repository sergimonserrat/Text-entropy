'''
English word entropy found in the literature is 9.8 bits per word
(Grignetti 1964). The lower entropy of Pride and Prejudice points to a higher
degree of order compared with a text of random English words. Given a word it
is easier to predict the next one than a randomly generated English text.

'''
English character entropy is 4.03 bits per letter using the first order model
described in Elements of Information Theory by T. M. Cover & J. A. Thomas, 2006
p. 170.
The higher value for Pride and Prejudice might be due to the inclusion of
numbers as characters, as they slightly contribute to the final information
content.
